## Project
This repository provides code and data to reproduce and extend the results
from the paper *Millimeter emission from supermassive black hole coronae*
(del Palacio et al., 2025 - https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.07762)

Run the jupyter notebook in the ipynbs folder.

If new sources are added, include a new file with the fluxes and initial parameters in the respective folders, following the same convention as with the other sources.
